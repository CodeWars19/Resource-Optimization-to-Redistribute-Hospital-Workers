# resource-optimization-model-for-redistributing-hospital-workers

A resource optimization model created using python to redistribute health care staff across hospitals in Washington state so that each hospital in meets has relatively similar population-health care staff ratios.

The current model redistributes health care staff amongst five out of the 590 hospitals in Washington.

The sites being optimizes can be altered as well as the desired population-heath care staff ratio.

The results of this model were compared to the results of ABDULSABOOR1995's model, and the model results were 95% similar.
