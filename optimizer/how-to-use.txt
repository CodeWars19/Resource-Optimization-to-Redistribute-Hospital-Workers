The current model is run using the data in the Modified_Data file, which is located in the datasets folder

To input your own values, navigate to the variables section of the file and replace the following:
1. Population - input an array containing the population of the zipcode that each hospital is located in
2. Current_Staff - input an array containing the current amount of healthcare staff working at each hospital
3. Ratio - input the desired population-to-healthcare-staff ratio
4. Max_Set - input the sum of all the values in the Current_Staff Array

Then run the model and you will see the optimized staff members shortly.
